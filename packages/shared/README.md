# @vue/shared

Utility functions and constants shared across packages. This package itself is private and never published. It is inlined into other packages during build - rollup's tree-shaking ensures that only functions used by the importing package are included.


跨包共享的实用程序函数和常量。这个包本身是私有的，从未发布过。在构建汇总的树抖动期间，它被内联到其他包中，以确保只包含导入包使用的函数。
